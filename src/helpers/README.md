# HELPERS

The helpers directory in a Node.js application is where you would store all the utility functions or modules that provide helper functionality to the rest of the application. These functions are usually not part of the core application logic, but are used across different modules to perform common tasks.

Some examples of the kinds of helper functions that might be stored in the helpers directory include functions for generating unique reference IDs, formatting dates or times, parsing data or query parameters, or validating input data. The exact functions included will depend on the specific needs of the application.

In addition to the helper functions, the helpers directory also contains a module for formatting and sending HTTP responses back to the client. This module can be used across different controllers and routes to ensure consistent response formatting and handling. It typically provides functions for formatting success and error responses, handling error codes and messages, and sending responses back to the client in the appropriate format (e.g. JSON, HTML, etc.).

By organizing helper functions and modules in this way, developers can keep their application code clean and modular, and make it easier to maintain and update the application over time. It also makes it easier to reuse code across different parts of the application and to ensure consistency in how common tasks are handled.
