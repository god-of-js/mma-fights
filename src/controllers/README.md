# Controllers

The controllers directory of this application is where the main logic for handling HTTP requests and responses is contained. It serves as the bridge between the HTTP routes and the database, allowing data to be fetched, updated, or deleted from the database in response to requests.

Typically, each controller file is responsible for handling a specific set of related routes, such as all the routes related to user authentication or all the routes related to trip management. The controller functions themselves define the operations that are carried out when a request is made to a specific route, such as fetching data from the database, processing user input, or returning a response to the client.

It's important to note that middleware functions, which perform actions such as authentication or input validation, are typically called before the controller function is executed. This helps to ensure that the controller functions receive only valid input and that requests are properly authenticated before any sensitive data is accessed or modified.

Overall, the controllers directory is a crucial part of an Express application, as it defines the functionality and behavior of the application's API endpoints. By carefully designing and organizing the controller functions, developers can create a robust and efficient API that is both easy to use and secure.
