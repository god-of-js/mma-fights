# SERVICES

The services directory typically contains external services that are used by the application, such as third-party APIs, libraries, or tools. These services may include SMS or email services, web sockets, or modules that allow the application to make requests to other platforms or services.

Services are usually implemented as separate modules or classes, with each service encapsulating its own functionality and API. The services directory may contain subdirectories or separate files for each service, depending on the complexity of the application and the number of external services being used.

By encapsulating external services in this way, developers can create a more modular and scalable application architecture, where each service can be easily swapped out or updated as needed. This can also help to reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the application over time.

It's important to note that services are typically used by other parts of the application, such as controllers or middleware functions, rather than being directly accessed by clients. This helps to maintain a separation of concerns and can help to improve the security and stability of the application.
