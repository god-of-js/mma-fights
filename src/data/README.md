# DATA DIRECTORY

The data directory in a Node.js Express application is where all the database-related files and functionality are stored. This includes connecting to the database, setting up the database schema, and defining models and repositories for the application's data.

One of the main components of the data directory is the models directory, which typically contains a set of folders representing different models within the application. Each folder contains two key files: the model definition file, and the repository file.

The model definition file, typically named [ModelName].model.ts, defines the structure and behavior of the model, including its fields, relationships to other models, and any validation or business logic associated with the model.

The repository file, typically named [ModelName].repository.ts, contains the actual database operations that can be performed on the model. This includes creating new instances of the model, updating or deleting existing instances, and querying the database for instances based on various criteria.

By following this naming convention and directory structure, developers can create a clear and organized way to manage their database-related code. It also makes it easier to maintain and update the application as changes are made to the data schema or database structure.
